## About this project

This project constitutes a Unity native plugin and a set of Unity C# script components that allows third parties to incorporate Servo browser windows into Unity scenes.

For more background information, see the blog post at https://blog.mozvr.com/a-browser-plugin-for-unity/

## Structure of this repository

1. The Unity project is `src/ServoUnity` with a sample scene at `src/ServoUnity/Assets/ExampleScene.unity`.
2. Native code for the Unity plugin is in `src/ServoUnityPlugin`.
3. The compiled plugin will be placed in `src/ServoUnity/Assets/Plugins`.
4. The Unity C# scripts designed to be used by the user's application are in `src/ServoUnity/Assets/Scripts`.

## Building from source

### Prerequisites

What | Minimum version | Where to download 
---- | --------------- | ------------
Unity | 2019.3 | <https://unity.com>
For macOS: Xcode tools |  | <https://developer.apple.com>

Only _macOS_ is supported during this development phase of the project.

### libsimpleservo2

Servo itself enters the plugin through the wrapper library `libsimpleservo2`. You can find a binary build of libsimpleservo2 at https://github.com/philip-lamb/servo/releases, or you can build it from source. This fork of the servo repository will soon be merged back to the main servo repo and these instructions will be amended once that is complete.

Build libsimpleservo2 from source:
1. `git clone --branch phil-ss2-headless https://github.com/philip-lamb/servo.git`
2. `cd servo`
3. `./mach bootstrap`
4. `./mach build --libsimpleservo2`
The release libraries will be built by default to path `target/release`.

### The servo-unity plugin build

The Xcode project for the plugin is at `src/ServoUnityPlugin/macOS/servo_unity.xcodeproj`. Compiling this project requires linking to Unity's plugin headers which are normally contained inside the Unity application bundle. Verify that the header search paths build setting for the Unity version that is currently installed on your system is accurate.

Before building, a build step removes any previous plugin build (`servounity.bundle`) from the Unity project's `Plugins` folder. 
The Xcode project builds the plugin bundle directly into the same folder. If you wish to change this behaviour, uncheck "deployment postprocessing" in the Xcode build settings.

## Operating the plugin inside the Unity Editor

The plugin can run inside the Unity Editor, but some setup is required first:]
1. At present, the plugin can be run and stopped once per Editor session. (This is because Unity does not unload and reload native plugins between runs in the Editor.) You'll need to quit and relaunch the Editor before running again.
2. The plugin currently looks for required GStreamer plugins at the same path as the executable; when running in the Unity Editor, this is unfortunately the path to the Unity Editor executable inside the Unity app bundle. You'll need to navigate to the libsimpleservo2 binary folder, and execute the following command: `sudo cp libgstapp.so libgstlibav.so libgstvideoconvert.so libgstaudioconvert.so libgstmatroska.so libgstvideofilter.so libgstaudiofx.so libgstogg.so libgstvideoparsersbad.so libgstaudioparsers.so libgstopengl.so libgstvideoscale.so libgstaudioresample.so libgstopus.so libgstvolume.so libgstautodetect.so libgstplayback.so libgstvorbis.so libgstcoreelements.so libgstproxy.so libgstvpx.so libgstdeinterlace.so libgstrtp.so libgstwebrtc.so libgstinterleave.so libgsttheora.so libgstisomp4.so libgsttypefindfunctions.so "/Applications/Unity/Hub/Editor/2019.3.13f1/Unity.app/Contents/MacOS/"`. You might even need to amend the final path for a different version of the Unity Editor.
